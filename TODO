Todo list as of 20081216:

- Support formats other than RGB888
- Identify why lwIP's malloc occasionally says out of memory after closing
  and attempting to reopen a connection.
- Support password-based (or better) VNC authentication.
- Automatically switch GRUB from the loader to the actual kernel
- Fix ridiculously slow video checksumming (i.e. make X usable)
- Make ACPI work?
- "Unknown TNT2 format ff" hang occasionally happens during startx
- Figure out why traps cause lockup in SMM.
